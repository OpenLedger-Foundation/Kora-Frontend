/**
 * Secondary market fee schedule (issue #597).
 *
 * Fees are disclosed before a trade is confirmed, so the numbers on screen and
 * the numbers charged must come from one place. This module is that place: it
 * owns the arithmetic, and the UI only formats what it returns.
 *
 * ## Why basis points, and why integers
 *
 * Rates are configured in basis points (100 bps = 1%) rather than as decimal
 * percentages, because `0.5%` in a float config is a rounding argument waiting
 * to happen. All rounding is deliberate and happens once, at the end.
 *
 * Money is rounded to cents with `Math.round`, and the **total is derived by
 * addition of the rounded parts**, never rounded separately. If the parts were
 * rounded independently of the total, a disclosed breakdown could fail to add
 * up to the disclosed total by a cent — which is exactly the kind of detail
 * that destroys trust in a fee disclosure.
