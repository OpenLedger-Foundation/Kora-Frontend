/**
 * Realized vs expected yield variance (issue #601).
 *
 * `expectedReturn` is what the position was underwritten to pay; `yieldEarned`
 * is what it has actually paid. The gap is the number an investor needs to
 * judge under- or over-performance against APR expectations, and nothing in
 * the app surfaced it.
 *
 * Status drives the interpretation, so it is modelled explicitly rather than
 * inferred from the numbers:
 *
 * - `repaid`    — settled. Realized is final, so variance is real.
 * - `active`    — still running. Expected-only: showing a negative variance
 *                 for a position that simply has not matured yet would read as
 *                 underperformance, which is wrong and alarming.
 * - `defaulted` — realized is final at whatever was recovered. The shortfall
 *                 is the loss, and it belongs in the aggregate.
