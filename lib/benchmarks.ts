/**
 * Configurable performance benchmarks (issue #603).
 *
 * Portfolio charts had no external baseline, so a 9% APR looked identical
 * whether the risk-free rate was 1% or 8%. These overlays give that context
 * without taking a dependency on a live market-data feed: the rates come from
 * build-time env vars, are explicitly labelled as static, and carry a
 * disclosure so nobody mistakes them for a live quote.
 *
 * Parsing is deliberately permissive-but-safe: a malformed value disables that
 * benchmark rather than throwing, because a bad env var should not take the
 * analytics page down. `lib/env.ts` validates required vars strictly; these are
 * optional presentation config and are treated as such.
