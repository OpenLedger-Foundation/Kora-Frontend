/**
 * Debtor Privacy & Masking Helpers — Issue #562
 *
 * Provides centralized privacy enforcement across marketplace cards, list rows,
 * comparison views, and screen reader announcements.
 *
 * Privacy Levels:
 * - "anonymized": Protects all debtor PII. Shows industry category moniker and jurisdiction (e.g. "Technology Company, Kenya").
 * - "partial": Displays debtor legal name, but masks street address (e.g. "Address hidden · Kenya").
 * - "full": Displays full debtor company name and street address.
 *
 * Post-Fund Reveal:
 * - Once an investor funds an invoice (`isFunded = true`), effective privacy elevates to "full" to allow legitimate contract verification.
