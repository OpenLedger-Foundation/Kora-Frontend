/**
 * Empty-state recovery suggestion builder (#564).
 *
 * When marketplace filters yield zero results, this module analyses the active
 * filters and returns up to 3 one-click "relax" actions that are most likely
 * to surface results. The caller (marketplace page) wires each action to the
 * Zustand store updater so a single click immediately re-runs the query.
 *
 * Priority order (highest impact first):
 *  1. Clear all risk tiers (often the most restrictive selector)
 *  2. Widen APR range to default (0–50 %)
 *  3. Clear jurisdiction filters
 *  4. Clear category filters
 *  5. Disable activeOnly toggle
 *
 * No more than MAX_SUGGESTIONS are returned so the UI never overflows.
