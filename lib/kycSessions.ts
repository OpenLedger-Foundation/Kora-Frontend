/**
 * In-memory registry of KYC status by wallet address — Issue #694.

 * The Synaps webhook is the only writer; `GET /api/webhooks/kyc` is the only
 * reader. The client polls that endpoint so a completed verification reaches
 * the wallet KYC tab without a hard refresh.
 *
 * Note: single-instance in-memory store, the same limitation as
 * `lib/verifiedSessions.ts` and the upload rate limiter — a multi-instance
 * deploy needs a shared store (Redis) or a real user record.
