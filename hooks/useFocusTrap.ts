/**
 * useFocusTrap — WCAG-compliant focus management for modal surfaces (Issue #439)
 *
 * Hand-rolled modal surfaces (`role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"`) that are not
 * built on Radix's Dialog primitive get no focus management for free. Without it
 * they fail WCAG 2.1 SC 2.1.2 (No Keyboard Trap) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order): Tab
 * walks straight out of the dialog and into the page behind it, which is still
 * rendered and still focusable, leaving keyboard and screen-reader users
 * stranded in content the dialog claims to have covered.
 *
 * This hook provides the three behaviours a modal owes its users:
 *
 * 1. **Initial focus** — moves focus into the dialog on open, so the next Tab
 *    lands on the dialog's own controls rather than the document body.
 * 2. **Containment** — Tab from the last focusable element wraps to the first,
 *    Shift+Tab from the first wraps to the last.
 * 3. **Restoration** — returns focus to whatever was focused before the dialog
 *    opened (usually the trigger button), so closing does not dump the user
 *    back at the top of the document.
 *
 * Escape-to-close is included because a trapped surface must always offer a
 * keyboard exit.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const ref = useFocusTrap<HTMLDivElement>(open, { onEscape: () => setOpen(false) });
 *   return <div ref={ref} role="dialog" aria-modal="true">…</div>;

 * Elements that can receive keyboard focus.
